    "\n",
    "The unit commitment problem (UC) in electrical power production is a large family of mathematical optimization problems where the production of a set of electrical generators is coordinated in order to achieve some common target, usually either match the energy demand at minimum cost or maximize revenues from energy production. This is necessary because it is difficult to store electrical energy on a scale comparable with normal consumption; hence, each (substantial) variation in the consumption must be matched by a corresponding variation of the production.\n",
    "\n",
    "Coordinating generation units is a difficult task for a number of reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "- the number of units can be large (hundreds or thousands);\n",
    "- there are several types of units, with significantly different energy production costs and constraints about how power can be produced;\n",
    "- generation is distributed across a vast geographical area (e.g., a country), and therefore the response of the electrical grid, itself a highly complex system, has to be taken into account: even if the production levels of all units are known, checking whether the load can be sustained and what the losses are requires highly complex power flow computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the relevant details of the electrical system vary greatly worldwide, there are many variants of the UC problem, which are often very difficult to solve. This is also because, since some units require quite a long time (many hours) to start up or shut down, the decisions need be taken well in advance (usually, the day before), which implies that these problems have to be solved within tight time limits (several minutes to a few hours). \n",
    "\n",
    "UC is therefore one of the fundamental problems in power system management and simulation. It has been studied for many years, and still is one of the most significant energy optimization problems. Recent surveys on the subject count many hundreds of scientific articles devoted to the problem. Furthermore, several commercial products comprise specific modules for solving UC, or are even entirely devoted to its solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "__Uncertainty in unit commitment problems:__\n",
    "\n",
    "A troubling consequence of the fact that UC needs be solved well in advance to the actual operations is that the future state of the system is not known exactly, and therefore needs be estimated. \n",
    "\n",
    "This used to be a relatively minor problem when the uncertainty in the system was only due to variation of users' demand, which on aggregate can be forecasted quite effectively, and occurrence of lines or generators faults, which can be dealt with by well established rules (spinning reserve).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, in recent years the production from intermittent renewable production sources has significantly increased. This has, in turn, very significantly increased the impact of uncertainty in the system, so that ignoring it (as traditionally done by taking average point estimates) risks significant cost increases. This had made it necessary to resort to appropriate mathematical modeling techniques to properly take uncertainty into account, such as:\n",

    "- Robust optimization approaches;\n",
    "-  Scenario optimization approaches;\n",
    "-   Chance-constrained optimization approaches.\n",

    "    - Benders decomposition (or Benders' decomposition) is a technique in mathematical programming that allows the solution of very large linear programming problems that have a special block structure. The strategy behind Benders decomposition can be summarized as divide-and-conquer. That is, in Benders decomposition, the variables of the original problem are divided into two subsets so that a first-stage master problem is solved over the first set of variables, and the values for the second set of variables are determined in a second-stage subproblem for a given first-stage solution. If the subproblem determines that the fixed first-stage decisions are in fact infeasible, then so-called Benders cuts are generated and added to the master problem, which is then re-solved until no cuts can be generated. Since Benders decomposition adds new constraints as it progresses towards a solution, the approach is called \"row generation\". In contrast, Dantzig–Wolfe decomposition uses \"column generation\". \n",
